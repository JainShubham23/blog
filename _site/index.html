          <a href="/blog/2025/12/20/Concensus-algoriithms.html">Consensus Algorithms, How Distributed Systems Agree in the Presence of Failure</a>
        </h2>
        <p><p>Distributed systems are fundamentally about <strong>coordination under uncertainty</strong>. Machines fail, networks partition, clocks drift, and messages arrive late—or never. Yet systems like Kubernetes, distributed databases, and cloud platforms must still <strong>agree on critical decisions</strong>.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>This AWS Machine Learning blog explains how to build a <strong>unified experiment tracking workflow</strong> by integrating <strong>MLflow</strong>, <strong>Amazon SageMaker</strong>, and <strong>Snowflake</strong>. The core problem it addresses is a common one in modern ML systems: data processing and feature engineering often happen inside a data warehouse (Snowflake), while model training and lifecycle management live elsewhere (SageMaker). This split makes experiment tracking and reproducibility harder.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>I recently read a deep engineering blog from Instacart that explains how they rebuilt their <strong>query understanding system</strong> using <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong> to improve search across millions of users. The core challenge they were solving was understanding what users <em>mean</em>, not just what they type — especially for ambiguous, noisy, or long-tail queries.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>Building conversational AI systems at enterprise scale is less about model quality and more about <strong>system design, latency control, and architectural discipline</strong>. Salesforce’s recent engineering post on <strong>Agentforce</strong> is a strong example of how real-world constraints shape production LLM systems.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>Modern cloud applications are powerful but notoriously hard to debug. As systems move toward microservices, Kubernetes, and event-driven architectures, observability data becomes fragmented across logs, metrics, traces, and events.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>DoorDash recently published a great article on how they use <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to improve recommendations across multiple business verticals like restaurants, groceries, and retail. Instead of replacing traditional recommender systems, they use LLMs as a <strong>semantic bridge</strong> between otherwise disconnected user behaviors.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>I recently tried out Hugging Face’s new <strong>Skills-based fine-tuning workflow</strong>, where a coding agent (like Claude Code) doesn’t just <em>write</em> training scripts, but actually <strong>runs end-to-end model training jobs</strong> on Hugging Face infrastructure. The experience was surprisingly smooth and changed how I think about fine-tuning large language models.</p>
